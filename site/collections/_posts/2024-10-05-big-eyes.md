On a research cruise dedicated to tracking the endangered North Atlantic right whale with NOAA’s Northeast Fisheries Science Center, one of the most powerful tools at our disposal was a pair of “big eyes”—massive binoculars that gave us an extraordinary view of the horizon from the flybridge of our vessel. These behemoth binoculars allow you can see far beyond what the naked eye could ever manage.

Our team on the cruise constantly scanned the horizon using the big eyes, each one covering about 90 degrees of the view in front of the ship, scanning the ocean for any signs of life. It wasn’t just whales we were on the lookout for; we tracked everything from fishing gear to shark fins, but the real excitement was the possibility of spotting one of the roughly 360 endangered North Atlantic right whales left in the world. The view through the big eyes was a clear split between pale sky and endless water, a sliver of the total panorama stretching out in front of the boat.

Each scan was a 30-minute shift—a necessity since constantly scanning the ocean can be tiring. And sometimes, a small speck on the horizon, barely noticeable to the naked eye, would reveal itself to be a massive fishing vessel in the distance. When we did spot something of interest, we would immediately relay it to a teammate stationed at a computer to plot the object’s location relative to the ship.

Spotting a North Atlantic right whale was what we were all waiting for, and the excitement that followed was palpable. These whales can be tricky to differentiate from others, like humpbacks or fin whales, especially from far away. But with their lack of a dorsal fin and the large white callosities on their heads, they’re unmistakable once you know what to look for. Every sighting meant we were contributing to the ongoing effort to track these whales’ movements and assess their health.

But the trip wasn’t just about whales. One of my most memorable moments came from tracking a pod of Atlantic white-sided dolphins. These sleek animals, with a striking yellow streak along their bodies, came swimming towards the boat while I was stationed on the big eyes. A couple leaped out of the water, and for a brief moment, I had an up-close view of a species I had never seen before. Seeing their grace while gliding through the water was awesome.
