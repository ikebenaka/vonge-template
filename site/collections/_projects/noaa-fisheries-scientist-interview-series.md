During my time at NOAA Fisheries HQ in Silver Spring, MD, I had the privilege of connecting with NOAA scientists from across the nation, each working at the forefront of climate change research and its impacts on ocean ecosystems. My goal was to delve into their full research journey—how they identified critical issues, developed methods to study them, and explored solutions in the face of a rapidly changing climate. Through engaging interviews, I helped bring their complex work to life, making the science accessible and captivating. The articles below debuted during NOAA Fisheries Earth Week 2022, highlighting these research stories.

In [**“A Better Chance for Resilience”: Using Hungry Fish to Conserve Coral Reefs**](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/better-chance-resilience-using-hungry-fish-conserve-coral-reefs "“A Better Chance for Resilience”: Using Hungry Fish to Conserve Coral Reefs"){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with Tye Kindinger, discover how grazing fish species are becoming unexpected heroes in coral reef conservation. By controlling algae growth, these fish help vulnerable reefs stand a better chance against climate change and other threats, promoting ecosystem resilience.
