While working in the Office of Communications at NOAA Fisheries HQ in Silver Spring, MD, I had the opportunity to speak with scientists from across the country whose research focused on climate change and how it was effecting ocean ecosystems. I wanted to ascertain their entire research process: discovering a problem, figuring out how to study it, and determining what could be done to resolve it in the face of climate change.
