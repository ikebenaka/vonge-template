      <p>Hi, I’m Isaac! My interest in environmental science started young,
      spending lots of time catching crabs and exploring estuaries. I’ve always
      seen the ocean as a vast frontier—one we still have so much to learn from.
      That curiosity led me to pursue a career in coastal and ocean science. I
      received a Bachelors in Environmental Science from Emory University and
      graduated from Duke University with a Masters in Coastal Environmental
      Management, where I worked in the <a
      href="https://marineuas.net/new/">Marine Robotics and Remote Sensing
      Lab</a> run by Dave Johnston. Now I'm a researcher and drone pilot at
      NOAA’s Northeast Fisheries Science Center.</p><p>I’ve been flying drones
      since 2013, when they first became more widely available, and I’m
      fascinated by the unique perspectives they provide. There’s something
      incredible about seeing the world from above, and it’s even more exciting
      to use that vantage point to further scientific research. My work combines
      technology, innovation, and the drive to protect our coasts and oceans in
      new, meaningful ways. I look to streamline processes in my research,
      making it easier for others to engage in science no matter their technical
      skill level. I believe there’s always room for improvement, and I love
      finding new ways to make methods more efficient to direct focus on what
      matters most—conducting impactful science.</p><p>When I’m not working, I
      enjoy DJing for friends, experimenting in the kitchen, hiking in nature,
      or enjoying a round of golf or soccer. Whether it’s through my research or
      personal interests, I’m always chasing new experiences and ways to explore
      the world.</p>
